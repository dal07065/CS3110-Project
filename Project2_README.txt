For Project 2 (implementing operators +,-,*,/ and (,), and operator precedence), I redid the project 1 through Java and 
implemented the rest of the operator feature using Java. I just could not pull through with python for the rest of the 
project.

Acceptable Inputs:
Has a decimal point: 2.0, 3.2
Has a decimal point and 'f': 2.0f, 3.0F
Has an exponent: 2.0e-1, 2e+1
Has an exponent and 'f': 3.0e+1f, 5e-1f
No decimal point or exponent but has 'f': 1f, 3f
Has underscore in between numbers: 10_00.0, 1.0_0, 10_0f
